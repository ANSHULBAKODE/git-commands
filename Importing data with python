import numpy as np
filename = 'xyz.txt'
data = np.loadtxt(filenname, delimiter = ',',
skiprows = 1, usecols=[0,2], dtype=str)

tab delimiter = delimiter='\t'


skiprows to skip the first row which contains the header of the file to 
specify the columns

usecols is used to define the columns which you want to use in the dataset.

dtype - to define that all the data is imported as strings

## handling different type of data type in a dataset with numpy.
  np.genfromtxt()
  to check the shape of the array in numpy-
    np.shape(filename)
    
You have just used np.genfromtxt() to import data containing mixed datatypes.
There is also another function np.recfromcsv() that behaves similarly to np.genfromtxt(),
except that its default dtype is None.
