 #### Important thing to note that numpy doesn't support dataframes concept it is the pandas which is used to 
 import dataset as dataframe rather than importing dataset as an array in numpy
 
 
 import pandas as pd
 filename = 'titanic.csv'
 data = pd.read_csv(filename)
 data.head()
 data_array = data.values ##converts pandas dataframe to numpy array
