As PEP 20 says, "Readability counts".


Importing data in Python

filename = 'xyz.txt' ## text file 
file = open(filename, mode ='r') ## r is to read , w is to write data
text = file.read() ## will read the file 
file.close() ## will close the connection to the file
print(text) ##will print the file


>>> with context??



open a file
file = open('moby_dick.txt', mode = 'r') ##opens the file and put it into variable = file
print(file.read()) ## will print the contents of the file
print(file.closed) ## checks whether the file is closed.
file.close() ##closes the file

##reading line one by one from a text file in python-
function used -readline() 
everytime the function readline() is executed it reads one line from the text-

	with open('moby_dick.txt') as file:
		print(file.readline()) ## reads and prints the first line of the text file
		print(file.readline()) ## reads and prints the second line of the text file
		print(file.readline()) ## reads and prints the next line of the text file

Here with is a context manager which manages to open the text file with the variable name file


>>>Flat files- Flat files are basic text files containing records that is table data without structured relationships.
Record- row of fields or attributes
column - feature or attribute 
first row is the header in  flat file
example- csv file, .txt - text file, commas or tabs- called as delimiters

## How to decided numpy or pandas-
	if the file consists of numbers then we could use numpy array
	or instead we wanna store the data in a dataframe we wanna use in pandas-
