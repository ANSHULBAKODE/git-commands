fork is to copy the whole repo from another person's account to our account to use it or edit it in our account
as we don't have the write priviledge to edit in that person's account

after i edited it and wants to contribute to that person's repo code and i want to share that with that person 
i can create a pull request to that person to accept our piece of edited code that's pull request as we cannot push it hence it is 
a request to pull our code.
